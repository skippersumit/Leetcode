* If the string is palindrom then it takes only 1 step to make the string empty.
* Otherwise any given string can be converted into 2 substrings of only " a" and only "b".
* The substrings only "a" and of only "b" is a palindrom string.
* Since the given string is converted into two palindrom strings which takes 2 steps to make it empty
* So, that if the giveng is palindrom then it takes only 1 step otherwise it takes 2 step to make it empty.
